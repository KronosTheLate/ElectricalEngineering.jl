# EE.jl

This is a Julia package on electrical engineering based on [Unitful](https://github.com/ajkeller34/Unitful.jl).
The processing and calculation of real and complex quantities is supported. Julia 0.6.2 is supported.

The non-official package EE.jl can be installed by (has to be done only once):

```julia
Pkg.clone("git://github.com/christiankral/EE.jl.git")
```

In order to update to the actual version of GitHub use:

```julia
Pkg.update("EE")
```

The module EE.jl has to be loaded by `using EE`. In order to use all the features of EE.jl, modules Unitful and PyPlot have to be loaded as well. It is thus recommended to appy:

```julia
using Unitful,Unitful.DefaultSymbols,PyPlot,EE
```

After updating to a newer version of EE.jl, the module can be reloaded without exiting the session by applying `reload("EE")`.

- Function `polar` to generate a complex quantitiy based on the length and the angle

### Circuits

- Constant `j` represeting the imaginary unit equvalent to `1im`
- Function `âˆ¥`
    - Calculate parallel connections of impedances
    - Calculate parallel impedance with or without units
  
### Input and Output

- Function `printuln`
    - Print complex variables (including) units in rectangular and polar form
    - Convert printed quantitiy optionally into a target unit
